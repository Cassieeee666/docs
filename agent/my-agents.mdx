title: "My Agents"
---

In Solvea, you can create multiple agents to support different business scenarios.

Each agent operates independently — with separate knowledge, channels, inbox, integrations, analytics, and contacts.

<Note>
  Bind different channels to different agents. All data modules (Knowledge, Integrations, Inbox, Analytics, Contacts) are isolated per agent and do not share data.
</Note>

## View Your Agents

Once an agent is created, you can view all agents from the **Home → My Agents** section.

<Info>
  A maximum of **10 agents** are displayed in the list.
