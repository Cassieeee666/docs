title: "My Agents"
---

In Solvea, you can create multiple agents to support different business scenarios.

Each agent operates independently — with separate knowledge, channels, inbox, integrations, analytics, and contacts.

<Note>
  Bind different channels to different agents. All data modules (Knowledge, Integrations, Inbox, Analytics, Contacts) are isolated per agent and do not share data.
</Note>

## View Your Agents

Once an agent is created, you can view all agents from the **Home → My Agents** section.

<Info>
  A maximum of **10 agents** are displayed in the list.

## Agent List

Each agent card displays:

- **Agent Icon**

  Different agent statuses have different icons.

  <Columns cols={2}>
    <Card icon="robot" horizontal>
      Completed agent
    </Card>
    <Card icon="message-text" horizontal>
      Agent in generation
    </Card>
  </Columns>
- **Last Updated Time**
- **Last Updated By**
- **Actions - Delete agent**

  Deleting an agent permanently removes all associated data, including:
  - Knowledge base
  - Integrations
  - Inbox records
  - Analytics data
  - Contacts
