# What Is an Agent

**An AI agent is a role-based AI receptionist designed for a specific business scenario**, equipped with multiple **skills** tailored to its job.

_For example: a hotel front desk agent may include Service Booking and Service Inquiry skills._

# How an Agent Works

**AI agents think and act like human staff.** A Solvea agent can:

- **Understand user intent** — Analyzes customer requests in real-time to determine what they need
- **Select the right skill** — Automatically chooses the appropriate skill based on the conversation context
- **Use connected tools and channels** — Integrates with your existing systems to take action and retrieve information
- **Immediate handoff** — Seamlessly transfers to human agents when needed

This allows the agent to handle both conversations and workflows autonomously, not just reply to messages.
