You can train and test your **Agent** from the **Playground** on the right side of the **Agent** page. This allows you to continuously refine how your AI agent understands instructions and executes tasks.

## Testing

Testing allows you to experience how the agent responds in real scenarios, using either text or voice input.

### Test Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    Choose **Voice Test** or **Chat Test**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Start a conversation or input test messages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Observe the agent’s responses and behavior.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Evaluation Criteria

Use the following criteria to determine whether testing is complete:

<Check>
  **Accuracy**\
  Whether the agent’s responses are correct. Test as many scenarios as possible.
</Check>

<Check>
  **Relevance**\
  Whether responses are relevant to user questions and maintain contextual consistency within a conversation.
</Check>

<Check>
  **Completeness**\
  Whether the agent follows all defined steps and completes the intended workflow.
</Check>

<Check>
  **Tone**\
  Whether the agent’s tone matches your expectations.
</Check>

### Refinement

Any issues discovered during testing can be addressed in the **Training** module. Continue refining the agent by chatting with the AI and providing updated instructions until the desired behavior is achieved.

## Training

Training refers to improving agent behavior by **Vibe Coding Builder** and providing additional instructions. The AI uses these instructions to adjust configurations and execution logic.
