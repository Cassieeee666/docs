You can train and test your **Agent** or **Skill** from the \*\*Playground \*\*on the right side of the **Agent** or **Skill** page. This allows you to continuously refine how your AI agent understands instructions and executes tasks.

## Training

Training refers to improving agent behavior by chatting with the Solvea AI and providing additional instructions. The AI uses these instructions to adjust configurations and execution logic.

### Training Scope

| **Training on the Agent page** | Updates the agent’s overall configuration, including all associated skills. |
