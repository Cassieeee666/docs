You can train and test your **Agent** or **Skill** from the **Playground** on the right side of the **Agent** or **Skill** page. This allows you to continuously refine how your AI agent understands instructions and executes tasks.

## Test

Testing allows you to experience how the agent responds in real scenarios, using either text or voice input.

### Test Scope

| **Test Area**              | **Test Scope**                                                                                        |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Test on the Agent page** | Evaluates the agent’s end-to-end performance, including how it selects and executes different skills. |
| **Test on the Skill page** | Evaluates the behavior and logic of the selected skill only.                                          |

### Test Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    Choose **Chat Test** or **Voice Test**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Start a conversation or input test messages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Observe the agent’s responses and behavior.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Evaluation Criteria

Use the following criteria to determine whether testing is complete:

<Check>
  **Accuracy**\
  Whether the agent’s responses are correct. Test as many scenarios as possible.
</Check>

<Check>
  **Relevance**\
  Whether responses are relevant to user questions and maintain contextual consistency within a conversation.
</Check>

<Check>
  **Completeness**\
  Whether the agent follows all defined steps and completes the intended workflow.
</Check>

<Check>
  **Tone**\
  Whether the agent’s tone matches your expectations.
</Check>

### Refinement

Any issues discovered during testing can be addressed in the **Training** module. Continue refining the agent by chatting with the AI and providing updated instructions until the desired behavior is achieved.

## Training

Training refers to improving agent behavior by chatting with the Solvea AI and providing additional instructions. The AI uses these instructions to adjust configurations and execution logic.

### Training Scope

| **Training Area**              | **Training Scope**                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Training on the Agent page** | Updates the agent’s overall configuration, including all associated skills. |
| **Training on the Skill page** | Updates only the configuration of the selected skill.                       |
