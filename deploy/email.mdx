| Authorization Method | Advantages                                                          | Disadvantages                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API**              | Simple and fast to set up                                           | Sync and sending speed are limited by the email service provider. |
| **Forwarding**       | New emails are synced within minutes for near real-time processing. | Requires manual setup.                                            |
| **IMAP/SMTP**        | Highly stable with a 10-minute email sync delay.                    | Requires manual configuration.                                    |
