### Twilio phone numbers

SMS must be configured in your Twilio account before use.

To enable SMS messaging with a Twilio phone number, you must first register for Twilio’s **A2P 10DLC service**. This is a required compliance process for sending application-to-person (A2P) SMS messages using U.S. long code numbers.
