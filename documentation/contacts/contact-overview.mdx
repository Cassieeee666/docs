The Contacts module helps you store, organize, and manage customer contact information in one place.\
By centralizing customer data, it enables more consistent communication, better follow-ups, and a lightweight CRM experience.

As Solvea handles customer conversations across channels, contact details are collected automatically. You can also review, manage, and export your customer contacts at any time.

## How Contact Work

Contact Module acts as the bridge between your Agent and your customers.\
When customers interact with your Agent, Solvea continuously builds and updates their contact profiles, allowing the Agent and human operators to respond with better context and accuracy.

### How Customers Are Unified Across Channels

Solvea automatically merges customer records based on identifiers:

- **Phone**: Same incoming phone number is treated as the same contact
- **Livechat**: Same email address or phone number is treated as the same contact
- **Email**: Same email address is treated as the same contact

<Info>
  If contacts from different channels share **the same phone number or email address**, they are automatically merged into a single contact profile.
