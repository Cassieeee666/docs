The inbox allows you to review AI-handled interactions and continue working on tickets that require human follow-up.

## What Is a Ticket?

A ticket is a structured record of a customer issue, including the conversation history, handling process, and final outcome.\
Compared to raw chat logs, tickets make customer support traceable, manageable, and easy to review—ensuring no request is missed.

## How Tickets Are Created

Solvea automatically generates tickets based on the channel:

- **Phone**: Each call creates one ticket.
- **Livechat**: Messages with the same Livechat ID are grouped into one ticket.
- **Email**: Emails that meet the following conditions will be merged into the same ticket.
  - from the same customer address
  - to the same email address
  - with similar subjects or same referenced email are merged into one ticket.
