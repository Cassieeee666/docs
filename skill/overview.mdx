Skills are the core capabilities that enable your Solvea agent to perform specific tasks.\
While an agent’s personality controls how it communicate, skills determine how it performs specific tasks.

Skills are designed for different channels:

- **Email**
- **Chat**
- **Inbound Call**

Each skill type includes channel-specific settings to match real-world workflows.

# How a skill Works

For the configuration, each skill includes:

- **When to use**: conditions that define when the skill should be triggered
- **Prompt**: instructions that define the skill’s behavior and capabilities
- **Tools and knowledge**: integrations and data the skill can access

When a customer message comes in, the agent evaluates the **_when to use_** rules across all available skills and selects the most appropriate one to handle the request.
