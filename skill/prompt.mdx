title: "Write a Skill Prompt"
description: "A skill prompt defines how a skill thinks, decides, and acts."

The prompt is the core of every skill. A well-written prompt can make a skill reliable and effective, while a poorly written one can break not only the skill, but the entire agent.

This guide shows how to use **structured prompt engineering** to build skills that behave consistently and perform tasks correctly.

## Structure Your Prompt

Avoid putting all instructions into a single block of text.\
Using a **modular structure** helps the AI model clearly understand its role, scope, and boundaries.

We recommend organizing every skill prompt into three core sections:

- **Role:** Define what responsibility the skill holds.
- **Tasks:** Describe the step-by-step workflow the skill should follow to complete its job.
- **Rules:** Set constraints, priorities, and edge-case handling to prevent unwanted behavior.

```
# Role
You are a assistant for... You are responsible for handling...

# Tasks
## Task1:...
1.
2.
## Task2:...
1.

# Rules
1. You should...
2. Never...
```
