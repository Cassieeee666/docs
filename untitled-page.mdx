Understand what an AI agent is and how it works in Solvea.

An AI agent is a role-based AI receptionist built for a specific business scenario. It is designed to handle specific tasks and customer interactions autonomously.

_\_ For example, a Retail Customer Specialist Agent can manage common e-commerce inquiries such as product recommendations, order tracking, and product usage questions._

## How an Agent Works

**AI Agent think and act like human staff.** A Solvea agent can:

- Understand customer intent
- Retrieve relevant knowledge from the knowledge base
- Use connected tools and communication channels
- Execute the correct task workflow
- Escalate to a human agent when needed

This allows the agent to handle both conversations and workflows, not just reply to messages.

## Build your Agents

You can create multiple agents for different industries or business scenarios.

Each agent operates independently and can be deployed across different channels without interfering with one another.
